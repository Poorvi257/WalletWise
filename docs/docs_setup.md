# API Documentation for `setup` Function

## Overview

The `setup` API function is an asynchronous endpoint designed to create a new wallet entry in a database. The function takes in the `name` and `balance` as inputs and inserts these into a database table called `Wallet`. It returns the generated ID, balance, and name of the new wallet upon successful operation.

## Endpoint

**HTTP Method:** POST

**Route:** `/setup`

## Parameters

### Request Parameters

- **name** (`string`): The name of the wallet to be created.
- **balance** (`number`): The initial balance to set for the wallet.

### Request Headers

- `Content-Type: application/json`

## Request Format

The request payload should be a JSON object containing the `name` and `balance` fields.

```json
{
  "name": "Sample Wallet",
  "balance": 1000
}
```

## Response Format

The response will be a JSON object.

### Successful Response

- **id** (`number`): The generated ID for the new wallet.
- **name** (`string`): The name of the new wallet.
- **balance** (`number`): The balance of the new wallet.

### Unsuccessful Response

- **error** (`string`): A descriptive error message.

## Successful Response Example

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Sample Wallet",
  "balance": 1000
}
```

## Unsuccessful Response Example

### Case: Missing Required Fields

```json
{
  "error": "Name and balance are required"
}
```

### Case: Invalid Balance Type

```json
{
  "error": "Balance must be a number"
}
```

### Case: Server Error

```json
{
  "error": "Failed to initialize wallet"
}
```

## Error Handling

- **HTTP 400**: Bad Request – This status is returned when either the `name` or `balance` is missing, or the `balance` is not a number.
- **HTTP 500**: Internal Server Error – This status is returned when a server-side issue prevents the wallet from being created.

## Additional Notes

1. **Input Validation**: The function performs basic input validation but does not sanitize the input for SQL injection.
2. **Connection Pool**: The function uses a connection pooling mechanism for database interaction. It is important to ensure that the pool is properly initialized before invoking this function.
3. **Error Logging**: Errors are logged to the console but are not persisted for auditing purposes.
4. **Resource Release**: Database connections are released back to the pool to ensure efficient use of resources. Make sure to monitor for any potential resource leaks.
